# Paarvai - An audio-visual aid for the visually challenged

This project is designed to help out those who have issues with seeing, and is designed to enable those who can't see to
understand the world around them. This project is designed to cater to the Indian audience where there are plenty of
languges spoken, and the visually challenged people are not able to understand the world around them.
